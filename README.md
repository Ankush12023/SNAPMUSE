<ul>Sorting Visualizer</ul>

This project is a visual representation of various sorting algorithms, allowing users to generate random arrays, select a sorting algorithm, adjust the sorting speed, and watch the sorting process step by step. It's built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Features
Dynamic Array Generation: Generates a random array of values, represented as bars of varying heights.
Algorithm Selection: Allows users to choose between Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, and Selection Sort.
Real-time Speed Control: Adjustable speed control to slow down or speed up the sorting animation.
Color Customization: Pick your preferred color for the bars in the visualizer.
Interactive Visuals: Updates the array's bars in real-time as the algorithm progresses.
Sorting Algorithms Implemented
Bubble Sort: A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order.
Quick Sort: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that picks a pivot and partitions the array around the pivot, recursively sorting the partitions.
Selection Sort: An in-place comparison sorting algorithm that selects the smallest element from the unsorted part of the array and swaps it with the first unsorted element.
How to Use
Generate Array: Click on the "Generate Array" button to create a new random array.
Choose Algorithm: Select the desired sorting algorithm from the dropdown menu.
Adjust Speed: Use the speed slider to control the speed of the sorting animation.
Change Bar Color: Choose a color from the color picker to customize the appearance of the bars.
Start Sorting: Click the "Sort Array" button to begin sorting and watch the algorithm in action.
Technologies Used
HTML for structuring the page.
CSS for styling and layout.
JavaScript for implementing sorting logic and interactivity.
Future Enhancements
Additional Sorting Algorithms: Implement more algorithms such as Merge Sort, Insertion Sort, Heap Sort, etc.
Improved User Interface: Add labels or tooltips for better clarity on each algorithm's functionality.
Array Size Control: Enable users to select different array sizes.
Algorithm Comparison Mode: Display sorting algorithms side-by-side to compare performance and behavior.
